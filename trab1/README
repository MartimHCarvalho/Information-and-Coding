To build:
	cd src; make; cd ..

To test:
	cd test
	../bin/wav_cp sample.wav copy.wav // copies "sample.wav" into "copy.wav"
	../bin/wav_hist sample.wav 0 // outputs the histogram of channel 0 (left)
    ../bin/wav_hist sample.wav 0 // outputs the histogram of channel 1 (right)
	../bin/wav_dct sample.wav out.wav // generates a DCT "compressed" version

To test exercise 2:
    ../bin/wav_quant <input_file> <num_bits> <output_file>
